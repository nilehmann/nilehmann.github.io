  abstract={In this short paper we present our preliminary results on implementing two-way regular-path queries (2RPQs) over a compressed representation of graph data. We report on several experiments comparing our approach with state-of-the-art graph database engines. Our results are encouraging; although we use a naive implementation for 2RPQs, our system exhibits a competitive performance compared with other engines.}
