			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				I'm a final year PhD student at the University of California, San Diego, advised by Ranjit
				Jhala. I'm interested in <emph>programming languages</emph> and
				<emph>program verification</emph>. My goal is to make formal verification part of the
				day-to-day development process by integrating formal methods into programming languages. I'm
				particularly interested in using these techniques to secure the low-level systems that power
				critical infrastructure. Check out my tool
				<a href="https://github.com/flux-rs/flux" target="_blank">Flux</a>, a refinement type
				checker for Rust that lets you specify a range of correctness properties and have them be
				verified at compile time.

				Outside of research, I'm a decent musician. You can check my college band, Modesto Medio, in

				> of me performing with some fellow PhD students at the holiday party. I'm also a beer connoisseurâ€”if
				you ever see me around, feel free to strike up a conversation about beer (or better yet, share
				one!)
